We are Rodopa Travel and we look forward to the opportunity to act as your booking agent for your travel needs. These terms and conditions (the "Agreement") describe what you are legally entitled to expect from us when you purchase travel related services through us, in addition to your obligations as a customer. The terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Rodopa Travel. The term "you" refers to the customer visiting our website, booking a reservation through us or otherwise using our services

1. Our Agreement With You

Products and Suppliers

We sell a variety of travel related products from different suppliers and service providers ("Suppliers"). Each Supplier has its own terms and condition that are applicable to your particular arrangements in addition to our general terms and conditions, and you should make sure you understand them. Certain software and content found on our website are owned or licensed by us or our Suppliers, your use of which may be subject to further conditions. 

Rodopa Travel is acting as intermediary or a "Booking Agent" for products and services that are not directly supplied by us (e.g., air carriage and ground transportation, hotel accommodations, meals, tours, cruises, etc.). We are not a co-vendor of such products and services. You will be entering into a separate contract with such Suppliers in connection with such products and services.

All airlines tickets are subject to supplemental price increases that may be imposed after the date of purchase. Post-purchase price increases may be applied due to additional costs imposed by a supplier or government. You may be charged additional sums by Rodopa Travel to offset increased fees, fuel surcharges, taxes, and fluctuations in foreign exchange markets or any combination thereof. Acceptance of these terms and conditions hereby consent you to any post-purchase price increases and authorize Rodopa Travel to charge my credit card for such additional amounts.
